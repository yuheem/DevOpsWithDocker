# 3.5

Document the image size before the changes.

Letâ€™s test what the image sizes are when using FROM golang and FROM node in the backend and frontend projects respectively.

Return back to our frontend & backend Dockerfiles and change the FROM to something more suitable. Both should have at least alpine variants ready in DockerHub. Make sure the application still works after the changes.

Document the size after your changes.

## Before

```sh
REPOSITORY                  TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
