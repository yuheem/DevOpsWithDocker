# 2.1

Without a command `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` will create logs into its `/usr/src/app/text.log`.

Create a docker-compose.yml file that starts `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` and saves the logs into your filesystem.

Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running `docker-compose up` if the log file exists.
